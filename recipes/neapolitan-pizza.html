    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Full Fat Low Moisture Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat pizza oven to 700-900 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a pizza peel that's been dusted with flour. Add toppings, being careful not to use too much, then immediately place on the baking stone using a shimmy shove motion. Avoid having the oven door open any longer than absolutely necessary to retain the heat.</li>
        <li>Keep a close eye on it as it cooks, rotating if necessary, but try to keep the oven door closed to retain as much heat as possible. It's done when the crust is lightly charred around the edges, the cheese is melted and the toppings are cooked, around 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove pizza, and allow to rest and cool slightly before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
